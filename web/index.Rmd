### Synthesizing multi-scale observations, manipulations & models.

This is a repository for the Soil Organic Matter Synthesis working group

Soil organic matter is a massive storehouse for carbon, as well as a key regulator of nutrient cycling and soil quality in terrestrial ecosystems, yet ecology lacks a full understanding of the controls on stabilization and breakdown of soil organic matter. This working group is synthesizing data across research networks to learn more about organic matter dynamics in world beneath our feet.
