# README ------------------------------------------------------------------

# overview

# This workflow largely mirrors harvest_HMGZD_drive.R, which was the workflow
# developed to aggregate homogenized data files but differs in that the worflow
# here works on a downloaded, unzipped directory of the content in
# `Data_downloads` (as opposed to pulling homogenized data files directly from
# Google Drive). This modified workflow became necessary as accessing the entire
# contents of `Data_downloads` became no longer feasible. The error message
# suggests a memory issue but some SO comments suggest that there is too much
# recursion. Regardless, harvesting via Google Drive seems no longer feasible.
# Another difference is that we are generally moving away from Aurora owing to
# the curl issue, so note that the output here is written to local file then
# uploaded to the project folder on Google Drive. Further, the modification_date
# formatting in the previous workflow has not been implemented here, and the
# list of columns to convert to character to facilitate binding of different
# variable types is specific to the data downloaed. Finally, because downloading
# the data occurs outside of R (i.e., is not a manual process), the time of
# harvest is no longer recorded. Instead, the time of aggregated file generation
# is noted, but careful that this time reflects the time that the the aggregated
# data were written to file NOT the time they were harvested.

# data harvest

# Workflow to harvest and merge homogenized data sets. The workflow starts
# outside of R with the user downloading and unzipping the `Data_downloads`
# directory from Google Drive to local file. For efficiency, the
# `Data_downloads` directory within the unzipped directory should be moved
# outside of the unzipped directory. The workflow identified directories
# containing a version 2 of the key file, then harvests the data files from
# those data files.

# data manipulation

# NOT IMPLEMENTED: The guess_date function in this workflow attempts to
# standardize the format of the modification_date field in each homogenized data
# set to faciliate merging.

# Some variables (e.g., L1, L2, tx_L1) are too diverse across data sets to
# standardize so are convereted to type character with the cols_to_character
# function so that they do not prevent merging. As new data sets are
# homogenized, add the column/variable name of any fields that are creating a
# merge issue to the targets list - any columns with a name in the target list
# will be converted to type character.

# data output

# After standardization, the list of data sets is merged into a single data
# frame. This data frame is then written to file and the Google Drive as both
# .csv and .rds files with the time stamp of when the data were aggregated.

# notes

# This workflow could be automated or, at least, sourced but because of the
# frequency of errors (e.g., new data sets with columns that have to be
# converted to character), it should generally be run manually.
